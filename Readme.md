# Caltech Altium Library

This library was developed by Jake Zimmer for use at Caltech. It contains both parts and templates for use in Altium Designer.

The parts library is organized such that the schematic libraries are grouped by part usage and the pcb footprint libraries are grouped by package type.

License for this is MIT. Feel free to use and modify as you see fit.
